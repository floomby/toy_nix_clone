toy_nix_clone
=============

A little toy nix clone that I worked on for a while. It predates my use of github, and therefore is not being developed anymore. It was a big learning project for me, and therefore it shall be archived here.

If for some reason you want to build it, you will need to build a cross compiler and you will need bochs and a copy of grub. Look at scripts/go.sh to observe the way I have the build process setup.
